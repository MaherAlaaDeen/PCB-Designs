# Line Follower Robot
## Objective
The objective of this project is to design and implement the hardware for a line follower robot. The robot uses IR sensors to detect a line on the ground and adjusts the motion of its motors to follow the line accurately. The hardware design includes a power supply, motor drivers, control unit, and sensor connections, all integrated onto a custom PCB.
