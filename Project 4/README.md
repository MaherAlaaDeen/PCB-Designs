# Astable NE555
## Objective
The objective of this project is to design and implement an astable multivibrator using the NE555 timer IC to generate periodic signals with a frequency of approximately 0.5 Hz. The design
is tailored for sequential circuit applications, with initial requirements specifying Ton ~ 1 sec and Toff ~ 1 sec for a Duty Cycle ~ 50%.

## Components Used
1. NE555 Timer IC: Used to generate the astable signal.
2. Resistors (R1 and R2): Determine the charging and discharging time of the capacitor.
3. Capacitors (C and Decoupling Capacitor): Control the timing and provide stability.
- - Timing capacitor C: 10uF
  - Decoupling ceramic capacitor: 10 nF.
