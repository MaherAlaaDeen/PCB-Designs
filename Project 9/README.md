# H-Bridge with DC Motor Speed Control
## Objective
The objective of this project is to design and implement an H-bridge circuit with integrated speed control functionality for a DC motor. The H-bridge allows bidirectional control of the motor, while a MOSFET-based PWM control regulates the motor speed. The design is compatible with an Arduino or other controllers and is inspired by modular motor driver circuits.
