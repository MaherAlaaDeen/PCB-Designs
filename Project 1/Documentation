# +12Vdc to +5Vdc Power Supply
## Objectives
The objective of this project is to design and implement a DC power supply that steps down a 12V DC input from a battery to a stable 5V output. This supply powers two devices:
- An Arduino or any other device requiring a 5V input via a T-block.
- A Raspberry Pi via a USB Type-C connector.

## Components Used
1. 12V Battery: Provides the input voltage to the power supply.
2. Capacitors:
- - Input Capacitor: Smoothens fluctuations from the 12V input.
  - Output Capacitor: Stabilizes the output voltage from the regulator.
3. Voltage Regulator (7805): Converts the 12V input to a stable 5V output.
4. LED Indicator: Provides a visual indication of the circuit's operation.
5. T-Block: Connects devices requiring a direct 5V input.
6. USB Type-C Connector: Provides a 5V power output for a Raspberry Pi.
7. Resistor for LED: Limits the current through the LED indicator.
